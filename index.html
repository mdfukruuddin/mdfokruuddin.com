                <h2>(1) What Is Web development?</h2>
                    <small>web development is a server-side scripting Job, embedded in HTML, that is used by programmers and developers to develop dynamic websites and applications. It's been around for a long time: It was originally created in 1994 and has since been adjusted over and over again.

web development is open-source and general-purpose, so it's a popular and highly practical language. As of May 2022, W3Techs reports that it is used by 77.4% of websites whose server-side language is known.

Confusingly, PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Processor. Yes, the P in PHP stands for PHP. We call an acronym that refers to itself like this a recursive acronym – originally, PHP stood for Personal Home Page.

Common uses of PHP in web development include, but are not limited to:

Performing system functions like creating, opening, reading from, writing to, and closing files

Adding, deleting, and modifying elements within a database

Accessing cookie variables and setting cookies

Restricting user access to certain web pages
